# AI-Decision-Assistant
This project simulates an AI-based decision-making system using propositional logic. It helps make decisions about commuting to work based on various real-life conditions such as weather, traffic, early meetings, and public transport strikes. The system uses logical reasoning to suggest whether to work from home, drive, or take public transport.
